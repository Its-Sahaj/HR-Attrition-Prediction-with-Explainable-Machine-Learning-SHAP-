# HR-Attrition-Prediction-with-Explainable-Machine-Learning-SHAP-
This project builds a predictive model to forecast employee attrition (whether an employee will leave the company) using HR data. It combines machine learning with explainable AI (XAI) to not only predict attrition but also explain the key factors behind each prediction using SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations).

🚀 Key Features
Predicts employee attrition risk using Logistic Regression.

Full end-to-end pipeline: data cleaning, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation.

Explainable AI: uses SHAP to visualize and interpret model predictions.

Helps HR departments identify at-risk employees and take proactive retention actions.

Interactive visualizations of feature importance and individual risk factors.

📊 Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Explainability (SHAP)

Google Colab (fully cloud-based)

💡 Why This Project is Valuable
Highly relevant for HR analytics and workforce management.

Demonstrates end-to-end data science and ML pipeline.

Adds explainability and trust to predictive models.

Great addition to data science portfolios for interviews or Kaggle.
